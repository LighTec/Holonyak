- Talk to the Arduino
- Get RGB values and send it to single LEDs
- Make a few simple LED patterns
- Build a simple GUI
- RGB selector on GUI
- Separate threads for GUI and Arduino comms
- Saving profiles
- Pattern timing
- More patterns
- Key logging for patterns
- Demo for what the strip does in the GUI
- Error detection
- Multiple strip support
- Strip size support (other than the 144 length strip that will be started out with) (at this point you should be able to select a grid of LEDs if needed)
- Support for buttons and switches on the Arduino
- Automatic profile detection
- Save files that make enough sense to be manually editable
- Multi-strip patterns
- Ability to unplug the Arduino and it will still operate (compile a profile onto the arduino)
- Clean up the GUI
- Program detection to automatically load certian profiles
- Other sensor support
- Custom pattern creator within the GUi
- Saving custom patterns
- Loading saves
- Changing colour based on system time
- Support for different/multiple ports on the Arduino that are used by the LEDs
- Use a picture of the LED strip to make the demo for the pattern on the GUI look nice
- Music visualization
- Date/time detection
