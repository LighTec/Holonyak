NOTE: INDIVIDUAL LED'S ARE POINTS


FOR LED STRIPS:

Waving pattern: x amount of points on the strip move along at y speed, having i 
and j colours between them, and have the colour between the points a 
mathematical average between them, with one colour more visible as it gets 
closer to the point.

One static colour.

Cycling all points with a spectrum cycle, moving 1 RGB value at a time. All 
points will be the same colour.

Math.random at x interval to each LED, either a hard cut to it or a cycle.

Detection for applications to change patterns

Key presses cause a flash going x quick with a width of y.

Device battery life?


FOR MULTI-ROW DISPLAYS

Text scrolling at x speed.

Matrix-type pattern with falling flashes of light with trails behind

Audio spectrum visualizer, low decibel frequencies start at x colour, then
once it gets louder morph to y colour and finally near max volume morph to z
colour.
